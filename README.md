## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to make a clients existing site more accessible.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
- What problem does it solve?
It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
- What did you learn?
I took the existing code and refactored it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.
